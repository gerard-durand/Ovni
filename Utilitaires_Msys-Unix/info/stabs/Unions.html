<pre class="example">     union u_tag {
       int  u_int;
       float u_float;
       char* u_char;
     } an_u;
     </pre>

   <p>This code generates a stab for a union tag and a stab for a union
variable.  Both use the <code>N_LSYM</code> stab type.  If a union variable is
scoped locally to the procedure in which it is defined, its stab is
located immediately preceding the <code>N_LBRAC</code> for the procedure's block
start.

   <p>The stab for the union tag, however, is located preceding the code for
the procedure in which it is defined.  The stab type is <code>N_LSYM</code>.  This
would seem to imply that the union type is file scope, like the struct
type <code>s_tag</code>.  This is not true.  The contents and position of the stab
for <code>u_type</code> do not convey any information about its procedure local
scope.

<pre class="smallexample">     # 128 is N_LSYM
     .stabs "u_tag:T23=u4u_int:1,0,32;u_float:12,0,32;u_char:21,0,32;;",
            128,0,0,0
     </pre>

   <p>The symbol descriptor <code>T</code>, following the <code>name:</code> means that
the stab describes an enumeration, structure, or union tag.  The type
descriptor <code>u</code>, following the <code>23=</code> of the type definition,
narrows it down to a union type definition.  Following the <code>u</code> is
the number of bytes in the union.  After that is a list of union element
descriptions.  Their format is <var>name:type, bit offset into the
union, number of bytes for the element;</var>.

   <p>The stab for the union variable is:

<pre class="example">     .stabs "an_u:23",128,0,0,-20     # 128 is N_LSYM
     </pre>

   <p><code>-20</code> specifies where the variable is stored (see <a href="Stack-Variables.html#Stack%20Variables">Stack Variables</a>).
